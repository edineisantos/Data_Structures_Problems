# Data Structures Problems

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program by Udacity. It encompasses a comprehensive exploration of various data structure concepts, demonstrating proficiency through practical Python solutions. Each problem addressed in this project represents a unique challenge that requires effective use of data structures and algorithms to solve efficiently.

The project utilizes Python 3, emphasizing clean, efficient, and readable code that adheres to best practices in software development and algorithmic design.

## Problems Overview

1. **LRU Cache**: Implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache mechanism that optimizes data retrieval and storage operations.
2. **File Recursion**: A recursive algorithm to find files with a specific file extension within a given directory and its subdirectories.
3. **Huffman Coding**: Application of Huffman Coding for lossless data compression, focusing on encoding and decoding messages.
4. **Active Directory**: Simulation of a user search within a hierarchical structure similar to Windows Active Directory using recursion.
5. **Blockchain**: A simple blockchain implementation to securely store data with cryptographic hashes.
6. **Union and Intersection**: Algorithms to determine the union and intersection of two linked lists without duplicates.

## Project Structure

For each problem mentioned above, the project repository contains two key files:
- A Python script named `problem_[x].py`, where `[x]` corresponds to the problem number. This script contains the solution to the problem, implemented in Python 3.
- An explanation file named `explanation_[x].md` for each problem, providing insights into the design choices, code efficiency, and the rationale behind the implemented solution.

These materials offer a glimpse into the application of data structures and algorithms to solve common computational problems, highlighting the balance between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to showcase the application of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems, demonstrating the ability to write efficient and understandable code. It serves as a practical component of the learning journey in the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree, preparing participants for future challenges in software and data engineering roles.

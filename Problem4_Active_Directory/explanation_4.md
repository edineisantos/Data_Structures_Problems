## Explanation of the Active Directory Problem Solution

The Active Directory problem simulates a hierarchical structure akin to Windows Active Directory, where groups can contain both users and other groups. This nested structure allows for complex membership arrangements. The primary challenge is determining whether a specified user is a member of a particular group, either directly or indirectly through nested groups.

### Recursive Approach

The solution employs recursion to traverse the group hierarchy. This method is particularly well-suited to the problem due to the potentially deep and complex nature of the group structures involved.

- **Base Case**: Initially, the presence of the user in the current group is checked. If found, the function returns true.
- **Recursive Step**: If the user is not found in the current group, the function recursively checks each subgroup. A positive finding in any subgroup (indicating the user's presence) leads to an immediate return of true.
- **Termination**: If the search through all groups and subgroups fails to locate the user, the function concludes with a false return value.

### Solution Components

- The function adds users directly to groups or subgroups, allowing for the building of the group hierarchy.
- It retrieves lists of users and subgroups, enabling the recursive search process.
- The approach is designed to gracefully handle various edge cases, such as null users or groups without members.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The recursive solution's **time complexity** is largely influenced by the depth of the group hierarchy and the number of members (both users and subgroups) within each group. In the worst case, where a user is not found, or is located at the deepest level, the function may need to traverse the entire hierarchy. Thus, the time complexity can be considered O(N), where N represents the total number of group memberships (including both users and groups) across all levels of the hierarchy.

The **space complexity** of the solution is primarily determined by the maximum depth of the recursive call stack, which corresponds to the deepest nested group structure. Therefore, the space complexity can also be seen as O(D), where D is the depth of the deepest nested group. In scenarios with very deep nesting, this could lead to significant stack space usage, though this is generally mitigated by the practical limits on group nesting depth in real-world applications.

### Conclusion

This problem highlights the effectiveness of recursive solutions for navigating hierarchical data structures, such as those found in systems like Windows Active Directory. The proposed solution efficiently determines user affiliations within potentially complex nested group arrangements, leveraging recursion to navigate the group hierarchy. The analysis of time and space complexity provides insight into the solution's performance characteristics, underscoring its practicality for managing complex group membership queries in a structured directory environment.

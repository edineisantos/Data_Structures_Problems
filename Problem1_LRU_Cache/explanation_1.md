## Explanation of the LRU Cache Problem Solution

### Success Criteria: Efficiency

#### Time Efficiency
The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache implementation is designed for high efficiency, achieving **O(1) time complexity for both `get` and `set` operations**. This performance is enabled by the use of two core data structures: a **hash map (dictionary in Python)** and a **doubly-linked list**.

- **Hash Map**: Provides constant-time lookup for cache operations, allowing the cache to quickly find the corresponding node in the doubly-linked list without iteration for `get` and `set` operations.

- **Doubly-Linked List**: Enables constant-time addition and removal of nodes. This list orders elements based on their access frequency, with the most recently accessed items near the tail and the least recently used items near the head. Operations that modify the list, such as moving a node to the end or removing the least recently used item, are performed in constant time due to the known predecessors and successors of each node.

#### Space Efficiency
The space complexity of the LRU Cache is **O(capacity)**, corresponding to the cache's capacity. This is because the cache stores each item precisely once in both the hash map and the doubly-linked list, without unnecessary overhead.

### Code Design

The integration of a doubly-linked list with a hash map is a strategic choice aimed at optimizing the cache's operational efficiency. This combination ensures that all primary operations, including adding new items, updating existing items, or retrieving items, can be executed in constant time:

- **Doubly-Linked List**: Chosen for its efficiency in adding and removing nodes from both ends, crucial for maintaining the cache's order based on usage frequency without significant time overhead.

- **Hash Map**: Selected for its ability to perform constant-time key-based lookups, facilitating swift operations within the cache.

This architecture is a well-recognized and effective approach to implementing LRU caches, striking a balance between fast access and the maintenance of a specific order of elements. The described setup, `Head <-> Cache1 <-> Cache2 <-> Cache3 <-> Cache4 <-> Cache5 <-> Tail`, elegantly illustrates the LRU Cache's operational logic, ensuring optimal use of cache space in accordance with item access patterns.
